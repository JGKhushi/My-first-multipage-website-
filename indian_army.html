    <img src="army.jpg"alt="">
    <p>The Indian Army is the land-based branch of the Indian Armed Forces. It is the world's second-largest standing army and the largest army. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and it is commanded by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two battalions of the Indian Army have been awarded the "Nations in conflict" peacekeeping medal. The Indian Army has a regimental system but is operationally and geographically split into seven commands, with the basic field formation being a division. It is an all-volunteer force and comprises more than 81,000 active troops and a support element of close to 1,160,000 troops.


        The primary objective of the Indian Army is to safeguard the nation's territorial integrity from external aggression and threats and maintain peace and security within its borders. It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural calamities and other restlessness, like Operation Surya Hope, and can also be requisitioned by the Government to assist in national emergencies. The Indian Army has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with China. It has also conducted numerous peacekeeping operations across the world.
        
        
        Indian Army consists of many regiments which are territorially based, and each regiment has its own cap badge, traditions and history. The units that make up the Indian Army are not all permanently based in one location. They are rotated between deployments in India and other countries as part of peacekeeping or training missions.
        
        
        The Indian Army is a very disciplined force and follows a strict hierarchy. Officers must salute their seniors, regardless of rank, and must obey orders from their superiors without question. The soldiers are also expected to maintain a high degree of personal hygiene and be physically fit.
        
        
        The Indian Army is one of the largest armies in the world. It has more than 1,160,000 troops who are available for deployment at short notice. These troops come from all over India and are drawn from all religions and regions. They are paid according to their rank and duration of service.

There was a lot of violence and bloodshed between the Hindus and Muslims in the partition of British India into India and Pakistan. The British Indian Army was divided between the two countries. The British Indian Army in Pakistan became the Pakistani Army. The British Indian Army in India became the Indian Army.
